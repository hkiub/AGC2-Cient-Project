    ### About the Data
    By examining the technology available in the market, we can determine the state of job openings.
    Through this visualization, we can pinpoint which technologies are in highest demand across
    different regions in the job market.
    When seeking employment with a company, various factors can come into play, including an
    individual's skills, abilities, education, and experience. These factors are often considered by
    employers when evaluating candidates for job openings.
    
    For this dashboard currently only limited tables are being used but in the coming days more tables will be added.
