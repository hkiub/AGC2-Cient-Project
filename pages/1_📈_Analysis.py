The Abilities table provides information on the required abilities for different occupations, which can be visualized using scatter plots based on the 'Importance' and 'Level' columns.
The scatter plots help to illustrate the relative significance of each ability for different job titles.
On average, Physicists require the highest level of ability for their jobs, while models require the least.
Another graph shows the average importance of different abilities across all jobs, with 'Oral Comprehension' being the most desired ability at the highest level, and 'Dynamic flexibility' being the least important.
